    <string name="numpuz_info">Numpuz 15 is indeed a puzzle game. It is commonly known as the 15 puzzle or Slide puzzle. The objective of the game is to arrange a set of numbered tiles on a square grid in ascending order, with the empty space in a specific position. Here s a step_by_step explanation of how the game is played: The game consists of a 4x4 grid, with 15 numbered tiles (numbered from 1 to 15) arranged randomly on the grid, leaving one empty space. The tiles can be moved horizontally or vertically into the empty space, one at a time. The goal is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them into the empty space, ultimately achieving the numerical order from left to right, top to bottom (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4 in the top row, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the second row, and so on). To move a tile, you click or tap on it if it is adjacent to the empty space. The tile will then slide into the empty space. The challenge lies in finding the correct sequence of moves to solve the puzzle, as some moves may lead to dead ends or an unsolvable state. The game is considered solved when all the tiles are arranged in numerical order, and the empty space is in the bottom_right corner. The 15 puzzle has been a popular and challenging brain teaser for many years, and it has inspired various adaptations and digital versions. Numpuz 15 is likely one such adaptation of the classic slide puzzle concept.</string>
